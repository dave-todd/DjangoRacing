				<h4>This is purely a demonstration of technology.</h4>
				It's functionality is questionable.<br>
				I set myself a challenge to do it all within 24 hours, it ended up being more like 36 after all the style and layout stuff<br>
				The web server is not production ready either, its just for development.<br>
				<br>
				Basically the web site for Racing and Wagering Western Australia has a history of meetings, races in meetings, and horses in races.<br>
				There is two web pages to get at this information :<br>
				1) www.rwwa.com.au/cris/meeting.aspx , which lists a meeting and all the races in it.<br>
				2) www.rwwa.com.au/cris/racefield.aspx , which lists the horses in a race, and a few other stats.<br>
				I have taken the information from these two web pages and amalgamated it into 1 page that shows all the races with all the horses for a meeting.<br>
				<br>
				The Python code scrapes the required information from a meeting and as many race pages as required and loads it into Python data structures.<br>
				Django then publishes this information back into HTML.<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Possible Enhancements :</h4>
				1) You could extend the code to store the data in a database.<br>
				2) You could get the results of the race from a third web page : www.rwwa.com.au/cris/raceresults.aspx.<br>
				3) You could derive some sort of statistics from the existing data.<br>
				<br>
				The CSS file is taken from www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp<br>
